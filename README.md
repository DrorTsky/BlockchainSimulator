# BlockchainSimulatorUniProj
This is a blockchain simulator that I've created inorder to visualise a uni project

In our uni project we have created a "blockchain" similar to the one in [SavjeeCoin](https://github.com/Savjee/SavjeeCoin).</br>
I've seen this as an opportunity to improve my react skills and created a GUI  with elements from [Material-ui](https://material-ui.com/).
